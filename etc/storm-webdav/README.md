# This is the StoRM WebDAV service configuration directory

The logback.xml file is used to configure the logging verbosity of the StoRM WebDAV service.
The logging configuration is monitored by the StoRM WebDAV service, 
so changes will be applied to the logging configuration without the need to restart the service.

The logback-access.xml file is used to configure the service access log, and should be normally
left unchanged.

The sa.d directory contains configuration information about the storage areas.
