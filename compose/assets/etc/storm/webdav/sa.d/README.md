This is the StoRM webdav service storage area configuration.

Each storage area is configured in a properties file. StoRM webdav will look 
for configuration in all files ending with .properties in this directory.
If no configuration files are found, the StoRM webdav service will not start. 

For an example storage area configuration file see:
	sa.properties.template
